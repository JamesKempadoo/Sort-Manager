# Sort Manager App
>Application allows users to run different sorting algorithms and see there difference in time.
> - Bubble Sort
> - Merge Sort
> - Binary Tree sort

> Installation
> - Download git repo
> - Open project within IDE
> - Run from sortLoader 
> - Dependencies
>   - Junit


> Usage
> - Run program from sortLoader Method
> - The program will run within command line 
> - You will first be asked what sort algorithm you wish to use. You will be able to input an integer with a range of 1 to 5 
>   - 5 being exit program
>   - 1 to 3 being the equivalent sorting algorithm
>   - 4 running all algorithm with an extra output showing the times it took to run
> - If you did not enter exit number it will ask for an Array size. You will be able to input an integer with a range of 1 to 1000 
> - It will ask you again if you input out of this range
> - This will then print out what algorithm was run, unsorted array, sorted array and time taken to run the sort.
